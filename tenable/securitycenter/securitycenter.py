        This class is designed to handle authentication management for the
        SecurityCenter 5.x API.  This is by no means a complete model of
        everything that the API can handle, it is simply meant to be a thin
        wrapper into the API.  Convenience functions will be added as time
        passes and there is a desire to develop them.
